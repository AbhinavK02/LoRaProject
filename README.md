## Introduction
All people have a lot to do and may not always have time to check their mailbox.
Imagine how long some letters are left in the mailbox for days just because one is too busy. On the
other hand, checking your mailbox only to find nothing is quite frustrating. What if there was a way
that your mailbox could tell you when there is mail? What if you had a talking mailbox?
To solve this problem, we introduce The Talking Mailbox. The aim of The Talking Mailbox project
is to design and assemble a system that can detect the presence of mail within a mailbox and notify the owner of the mailbox.
