\subsection{Project Summary}
Overall, the results validate the original design objectives of \project and demonstrate a clear improvement over existing smart mailbox solutions. By combining direct mail detection, low-power operation, and long-range wireless communication, the project delivers a practical and novel solution to the problem of unattended mailboxes. \project not only confirms the feasibility of weight-based mail detection but also establishes a foundation for future enhancements such as multi-mailbox management, cloud deployment, and enhanced user interaction.

\subsection{Future Work / Improvements}
While working on The Talking Mailbox project, several areas for potential improvements were identified 
that could enhance the functionality, reliability, and user experience of the system. These improvements 
include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Better tampering detection}: While the LDR and tilt sensor provide good and reliable tampering detection, they can be replaced with a single reed swich. This would reduce complexity and power consumption.
    \item \textbf{Improved housing}: Housing of the components can be combined with load cell platform for a better fit and protection of the components.
    \item \textbf{Additional information}: A camera can be added to capture images of the mail inside the box. This would provide visual confirmation of mail presence and enhance user experience. An LED can be used in conjunction 
                                            with the camera to provide illumination inside the mailbox even when closed.
    \item \textbf{Easier server access}: The server can be deployed on a local raspberry pi or similar device to allow for local access and control. This would eliminate the need for an external hosting service and provide more flexibility.
    \item \textbf{Tampering alert}: A buzzer can be added to the box, to alert surroundings when tampering is detected. This would enhance security and deter unauthorized access.
    \item \textbf{Enhanced power management}: A piezo can also be added to the lid to harvest energy from the opening and closing of the mailbox. This would extend battery life and reduce maintenance.
    \item \textbf{Expansion to multiple mailboxes}: The system can be expanded to support multiple mailboxes, serving multiple users from a single controller. With the existing device ID set-up in the code, this can be achieved simply by connecting multiple sensor configs to the MCU using multiplexers and expanding the payload by prefixing the unique device ID before the sensor data.
\end{itemize}
